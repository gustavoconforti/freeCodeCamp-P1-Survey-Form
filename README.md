# My precious form

This is my first ever webpage. It has static features only, leads to nowhere and was developed for the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design curriculum.

I meant to create an elegant looking form page, similiar to most modern UI trends. The Poppins font choice came from the example form ([https://survey-form.freecodecamp.rocks](https://survey-form.freecodecamp.rocks/)), the rest pulls from many different sources.

While I am happy with how clean it is, something looks off ðŸ¤”
